# Disease_Prediction_Based_On_Symptoms-
Analyses the Machine Learning techniques that can predict different types of diseases. 

We have implemented the following algorithms in code:

1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Naive Bayes
   
# Usage

Please make sure to install all dependencies before running the demo, using the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Interactive Demo

For running an interactive demo or sharing it with others, please run `demo.py` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

```
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```

## Standalone Demo

For running the inference on test set or on custom inputs, you can also use the `infr.py` file as follows:

```
python infer.py
```
